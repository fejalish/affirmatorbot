# Setup

The slackbot container needs a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` ENV var to run. This value must be the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" from your Slack app.

# Docker Compose

## Setup

Ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed locally.

Copy `development.env.sample` and save it as `development.env`. Edit the file and put the token as the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` value.

## Commands

To run locally via docker-compose run the following commands.

```
docker-comopse build
docker-comopse up
```

# Kubernetes

## Setup

Ensure `minikube` and `docker` are installed locally.

Copy `k8s/secrets.env.sample` and save it as `k8s/secrets.yaml`.

`base64` encode the slack token, like the following:

```
echo -n 'slack-token-here' | base64
```

Edit the file and put the token as the `slack_bot_token` value.

## Commands

To run locally via minikube run the following commands.

```
cd k8s
kubectl apply -f ./secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml
```
