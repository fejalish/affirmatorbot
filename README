# Setup

The slackbot container needs a `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` ENV var to run. This value must be the "Bot User OAuth Access Token" from your Slack app.

# Docker Compose

## Setup

Ensure `docker` and `docker-compose` are installed locally.

Copy `development.env.sample` and save it as `development.env`. Edit the file and put the token as the `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` value.

## Commands

To run locally via docker-compose run the following commands.

```
docker-comopse build
docker-comopse up
```

# Kubernetes

## Setup

Ensure `minikube` and `docker` are installed locally.

Copy `k8s/secrets.env.sample` and save it as `k8s/secrets.yaml`.

`base64` encode the slack token, like the following:

```
echo -n 'slack-token-here' | base64
```

Edit the file and put the token as the `slack_bot_token` value.

## Commands

To run locally via minikube run the following commands.

```
cd k8s
kubectl apply -f ./secrets.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./deployment.yaml
```

Note: the deployment uses a published version of the docker image in this repo. If you wish to build and test your own image edit the deployment and set the container image to the name of your local image.
